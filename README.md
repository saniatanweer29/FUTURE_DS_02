📊 Advertising Performance & Sales Efficiency Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

This project is developed as part of the Future Interns – Data Science & Analytics Internship (Task 2).
The objective of this task is to analyze advertising spend across different marketing channels and evaluate their impact on product sales and ROI (sales efficiency) using Power BI.

The dashboard provides clear, business-focused insights into how advertising budgets are distributed and how effectively they contribute to sales.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze advertising spend across multiple channels

Identify high-performing and high-spending channels

Evaluate ROI (Sales Efficiency) for better decision-making

Present insights using an interactive and professional dashboard

🗂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains advertising expenditure across the following channels:

Social Media

Google Ads

TV

Billboards

Affiliate Marketing

Influencer Marketing

It also includes:

Product_Sold – representing sales output

⚠️ Note:
The dataset does not include clicks, impressions, geographic, or time-based fields.
Therefore, metrics like CTR, CPC, Engagement Rate, and Maps were intentionally not used to avoid misleading analysis.

🔹 Interactivity

Channel Selector Slicer (Field Parameter)

Visual-level interactions for better exploration.

🎛 Slicer & Interaction Design

A Field Parameter slicer is used to dynamically switch channels in selected charts.

Slicers are limited to valid fields only, based on dataset availability.

No fake or unsupported filters (such as date, region, or demographics) are included.

🎨 Design Choices

Minimal and professional color palette

Clear visual hierarchy (KPIs → Analysis → Insights)

Clean spacing and readable labels

Avoided unnecessary visuals to maintain clarity

🧠 Key Insights

Digital advertising channels show higher efficiency compared to traditional channels.

Certain channels consume higher budgets but deliver comparatively lower ROI.

Reallocating budgets toward high-ROI channels can improve overall performance.
